# Chlorophyll A Fluorescence Curve Optimization

This repository supports the content presented in the blog post available at [My Intro to ML: Chlorophyll A Induced Fluorescence Curves and Gradient Descent](https://franciscosanchez23t.wordpress.com/2024/01/15/my-intro-to-ml-chlorophyll-a-induced-fluorescence-curves-and-gradient-descent/).

## Overview

In summary, the project involves enhancing the performance of a Gillipse algorithm utilized for computing Chlorophyll A Fluorescence curves. By transforming the algorithm into a differentiable function through statistical and calculus techniques, the C++ program's efficiency increases by a factor of 6946. Additionally, a gradient descent algorithm is implemented and tested.
